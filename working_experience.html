<p>
I have enlisted into Military in April 2015 to go thru BMT. After BMT, I was being posted to Signal Institute to specialist on HF and VHF Radio. I was in service for 1years 8 months, I was participated in oversea exercise which my superior saw potential in my skills and requested my sign on and join as a regular in MINDEF. </p>

<p>I was promoted to rank sergeant and was given oppurtunity to be network administrator for the SATCOM. I was task to maintain 15 fleet of SATCOM vehicle and with a team of 5 regular and 15 enlistee. With my skills and knowledge, my superior ask me to participate oversea attachment with Singapore Technology Electronics (STE) to train with Australian people. </p>

<p>I also have to plan curriculum schedules and need to prepare effective lessons for the enlistees and to ensure that they have the basic knowledge to operate the equipment. With handling both operation and training. I developed and wrote the first note for SATCOM procedure manual guide called SOP, so that the next generation will able to operate the system safer and easier.</p>

<p>In my free time, I usually invite my peers to participate volunteering work or events. I have particapated in Singapore books of record "Most lunges Performed in 30min" and "Largest 10-legged Race".
